1. Schedule Automatic Renewal with Cron:
Open the crontab editor:
```bash
crontab -e
```

Add a line to run the renewal script once a week:

```plaintext
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/renew_cert.sh
```

This cron schedule (0 0 * * 0) translates to running the script every Sunday at midnight.

Important Note:
Make sure the cron schedule aligns with your preferred timing. You can use online cron expression generators to help you customize the schedule according to your specific needs.

With this setup, your certificates will be renewed automatically every week on the specified day and time. Adjust the paths and settings as needed based on your Docker setup and environment.
